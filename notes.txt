DEVELOPMENT STEPS:

- Display the map with react-map-gl library
- Show Berlin on the map and make it static 
- Use deck.gl to visualize the data points as scatter plots on the map 
- Show the value of a given point by increasing the radius
- Display all data points in one static color

- Show tooltip and the date on the current bike count when hovering over the data points
- Add a functionality that allows the user to narrow down the displayed data to some time range defined by a start and end date
